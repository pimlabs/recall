# Homebrew formula for Recall.
#
#   brew install pimlabs/tap/recall          # latest release, a download
#   brew install --HEAD pimlabs/tap/recall   # built from main, between releases
#
# The tap is pimlabs/homebrew-tap, shared with the other pimlabs tools, which
# is what lets Homebrew infer the URL from `pimlabs/tap` — a formula living in
# this repository instead would need `brew tap pimlabs/recall <url>` first,
# since `recall` is not named `homebrew-*`.
#
# THIS FILE IS THE SOURCE. scripts/release.sh rewrites the version and the
# four checksums from the release's own checksums.txt, then copies it into the
# tap. Edit it here; the copy in the tap is output.
#
# The stable install takes a prebuilt archive rather than compiling: the
# release workflow already publishes the same four binaries npm and install.sh
# use, and building them again locally means a Rust toolchain plus SQLite's C
# amalgamation for no difference in the result. `--HEAD` still compiles,
# because there is nothing prebuilt to point it at.
